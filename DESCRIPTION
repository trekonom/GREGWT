Description: Implements the GREGWT (Generalised Regression and Weighting of
    sample survey results) algorithm in the R language. The algorithm implemented in
    this package is based on: Singh, A. & Mohl, C. (1996) Understanding calibration
    estimators in survey sampling Survey Methodology, 22 , 107-115; Bell, P.
    (2000). Weighting and standard error estimation for ABS household surveys (paper
    prepared for ABS methodology advisory committee); and Tanton, R.; Vidyattama,
